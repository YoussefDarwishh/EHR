# Project Description

EHR (Electronic Healthcare Report System) is a desktop application, which could be used by the public and the healthcare field. The EHR would collect and store data on patients' treatment, test results, scans, medicine prescriptions, and medical history with their exact dates at public and private hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics. This would enable faster access to a patient's past medical records and ensure accurate data and eliminate the risk of lost medical documents. The information in these systems is input and managed by authorized healthcare practitioners within a specific healthcare organization. The application would come with multiple user-friendly interfaces, providing different functionalities depending on who the user is. For example, the patient would be able to view their medical history, view lab results and could even
become an organ donor.
Hospitals and clinics could apply to be on our database system to get patient-generated data,
medication process tracking, and show their laboratory results.
Pharmacies could also apply to be on our database system to show patients' current illnesses and
required medication and give them their medications.

# Required Software
